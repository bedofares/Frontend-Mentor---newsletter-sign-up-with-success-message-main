### What I learned

I would not call it learning  , i would call it a nice recap to what i have learned before .I would say that i learned some new css stuff 


### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing responsive design as it is an important concept . I would also like to practice writing a clean and organized code that other developers can go through and easily understand what it does .
